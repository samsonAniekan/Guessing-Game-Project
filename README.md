# Guessing-Game-Project
Our objective for this project is to build a simple game where the user has to guess a secret number that is chosen at random. Upon making a guess, the user will receive a hint indicating if their guess is too small or too large. Below is an example of how the final product will play. We've denoted the user's input with *asterisks*.
